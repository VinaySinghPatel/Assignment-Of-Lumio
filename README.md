This is the frontend of the Lumio Partners project, built using React.js. To run it locally, make sure you have Node.js (v16 or later) and npm or yarn installed. Clone the repository, navigate into the project folder, and install dependencies using npm install or yarn install. Create a .env file in the root directory and set REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL to your backend URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000). Start the development server with npm start or yarn start, and access the app at http://localhost:3000. To build for production, use npm run build, which generates optimized files in the build folder. Keep the .env file out of version control for security.
